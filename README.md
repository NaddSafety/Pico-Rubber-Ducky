<h1>Description</h1>

Project Pico Rubber Ducky is a creative endeavor that harnesses the power of Raspberry Pi and CircuitPython to create a versatile BADUSB (a type of malicious USB device) tool. By leveraging the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller and CircuitPython, this project enables users to emulate a keyboard and execute keystroke injection attacks on target systems, demonstrating the potential security risks posed by USB-based attacks.

<h1>Impact</h1>

- Educational Tool: Project Pico Rubber Ducky serves as an educational resource for exploring the concepts of USB-based attacks and cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
- Versatility: By utilizing Raspberry Pi and CircuitPython, this project offers flexibility and customization options for adapting to different use cases and scenarios.
  
<h1>Tools Used</h1>

- Raspberry Pi Pico: Microcontroller used for controlling the USB functionality and executing keystroke injection attacks.
- CircuitPython: Programming language and development environment used for writing the firmware and controlling the behavior of the BADUSB device.
- DuckyScript:  a simple scripting language used for creating payloads to be executed by USB Rubber Ducky devices.
